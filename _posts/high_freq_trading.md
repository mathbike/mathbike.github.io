### Trading as a function of time vs. trading as a function of price

High frequency trading is trading as a function of time.  Meaning that, within a certain time interval, something must happen.  Where as in trading as a function of price, if your price levels aren't reached, your money remains locked in that asset, waiting.

For trading as a function of time to be profitable, the sum of all your wins must be greater than the sum of all your losses.
