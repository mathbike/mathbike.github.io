A Flask application is an instance of the Flask class.

**Application Factory:**

The application factory function is the `create_app()` function in the `<app_name>/__init__.py` file.  Any configuration, registration, and other setup the application needs will happen inside this function, then the application will be returned.

**Views:**

A view function is the code you write to respond to requests to your application.  The incoming request URL is matched to the view that should handle it.  The view returns data that Flask turns into an outgoing response.  Flask can also go the other direction and generate a URL to a view based on its name and arguments.

A view function can return HTML using the `render_template('index.html')` function.

**Blueprints:**

A Blueprint is a way to organize a group of related views and other code.

**Templates:**
