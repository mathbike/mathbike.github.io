**iSH is an Alpine Linux shell environment that runs locally on iOS devices.  Alpine uses the apk package manager and comes with the ash shell.**

I use the Obsidian markdown editor to take markdown notes on my phone.  I want those notes to be automatically pushed to GitHub.  We can do this with inotify, which is an API for monitoring filesystem events.

After you've installed the iSH app:

### Upgrade

```terminal
apk upgrade
```

### Install packages

```terminal
apk add util-linux vim git github-cli inotify-tools
```

Util-linux includes the basic utilities like umount and whereis.  Vim is my text editor.  You obviously need git, and github-cli allows us to save our GitHub credentials.  Inotify-tools monitors files for changes, which we will use to automatically push after a note has changed.

### Make the mount directory

```terminal
mkdir obsidian
```

### Mount the ios files to obsidian

```terminal
mount -t ios . obsidian
```

This will bring up a file selector.  Select the `Obsidian` folder.

### Create your repo on GitHub

This will be your Obsidian vault.  My vault will be called notes.

### Clone the repo

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/mathbike/notes.git ~/obsidian/notes
```

The password field is your PAT, not your password.

### Update the git config with your information

```terminal
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

```terminal
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

- Mark directory as safe

```terminal
git config --global --add safe.directory /root/obsidian/notes
```

### Create the push script `push.sh`

`vim push.sh`

```sh
#!/bin/ash
cd ~/obsidian/notes
git add .
git commit -m "Commit from mobile"
git push
```

Change the directory to the name of your vault.

### Add an alias to call the script

- Open the `.profile` file for editing:

```terminal
vim .profile
```

- Add your alias:

```profile
alias n="sh push.sh"
```

### Save your GitHub credentials

```terminal
gh auth login
```

- Select SSH

- Paste your PAT

Now when you push and enter your credentials they will be saved.
