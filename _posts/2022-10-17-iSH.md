**iSH is an Alpine Linux shell environment that runs locally on iOS devices.  Alpine uses the apk package manager and comes with the ash shell.**

I use the Obsidian markdown editor to take markdown notes on my phone.  I want those notes to be automatically pushed to GitHub.  We can do this with inotify, which is an API for monitoring filesystem events.

After you've installed the iSH app:

### Upgrade

```terminal
apk upgrade
```

### Install packages

```terminal
apk add util-linux vim git github-cli inotify-tools
```

Util-linux includes the basic utilities like umount and whereis.  Vim is my text editor.  You obviously need git, and github-cli allows us to save our GitHub credentials.  Inotify-tools monitors files for changes, which we will use to automatically push after a note has changed.

### Make the mount directory

```terminal
mkdir obsidian
```

### Mount the ios files to obsidian

```terminal
mount -t ios . obsidian
```

This will bring up a file selector.  Select the `Obsidian` folder.

### Create your repo on GitHub

This will be your Obsidian vault.  My vault will be called notes.

### Clone the repo

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/mathbike/notes.git ~/obsidian/notes
```

The password field is your PAT, not your password.

### Update the git config with your information

```terminal
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

```terminal
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

- Mark directory as safe

```terminal
git config --global --add safe.directory /root/obsidian/notes
```

### Create the push script `push.sh`

`vim push.sh`

```sh
#!/bin/ash
cd ~/obsidian/notes
git add .
git commit -m "Commit from mobile"
git push
```

Change the directory to the name of your vault.

### Add an alias to call the script

- Open the `.profile` file for editing:

```terminal
vim .profile
```

- Add your alias:

```shell
alias n="sh push.sh"
```

### Save your GitHub credentials

```terminal
gh auth login
```

- Select SSH

- Paste your PAT

Now when you push and enter your credentials they will be saved.



Root

You are not root for the iOS device, you are root for the emulated Alpine Linux system.

Terminal prompt

I like my terminal prompt to be green.  You need tput to do this Ncurses is the package that contains tput

```terminal
apk add ncurses
```


```sh
# terminal promt
off=$(tput sgr0)
green=$(tput setaf 71)
PS1='${green}[\u@\h \W]\$ ${off}'
```

Using custom fonts

Install the iFont app.  Go to the “Font Finder” tab.  Select Google fonts.  Find the font you want and follow the install instructions.  Your font will now be available to select in the iSH settings.

Git problem

The apk version of git didn’t work for me so I had to switch to an older version

```terminal
apk del git
wget https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.11/main/x86/git-2.24.4-r0.apk
apk add ./git-2.24.4-r0.apk
git config --global pack.threads "1"
```
