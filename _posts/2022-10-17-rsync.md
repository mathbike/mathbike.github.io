**The rsync tool, short for remote sync, is a file synchronization tool.  Like git, it transfers only the data that has changed.**

## Install

Arch Linux:
```terminal
sudo pacman -S rsync
```

Debian:
```terminal
sudo apt-get install rsync
```

---


```terminal
user@ip_address:mnt/backup
```
Then enter password

## Use

To use rsync, run the rsync command followed by any flags, then the source location followed by the destination location:
```terminal
rsync -r source destination
```
    - The -r flag recurses into directories.  Without it rsync will only copy the files within the directory, not the directories within the directory.

Use **\*** to select all **files only** within the directory:
```terminal
rsync -r source/* destination
```

Use the -r flag with a trailing slash to recursively select all **files and directories** within the directory:
```terminal
rsync -r source/ destination
```

Without a trailing slash syncs the directory itself:
```terminal
rsync -r source destination
```

The -a flag indicates archive, which means that file characteristics such as permissions, groups, owners, and symlinks are preserved:
```terminal
rsync -a source/ destination
```

The progress flag shows a progress bar:
```terminal
rsync -a -progress source/ destination
```

The -P flag is the same as --progress and --partial.  It will show a progress bar and keep partially transferred files:
```terminal
rsync -a -P source/ destination
```

## Trailing slash caveat

## Dry run option

Use the --dry-run flag to check what will be synced before running.  Include the -v flag (verbose) to show the output in the terminal:
```terminal
rsync -av â€”dry-run source/ destination
```
