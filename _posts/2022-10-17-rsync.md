**The rsync tool, short for remote sync, is a file synchronization tool.  Like git, it only transfers the data that has changed.**

## Install

Arch Linux:
```terminal
sudo pacman -S rsync
```

```terminal
sudo apt-get install rsync
```

Use

rsync -r source/* destination

Use a * to select all files within the directory

rsync -r source/ destination

Use the -r flag with a trailing slash to recursively select all files and directories within the directory

rsync -r source destination

Without a trailing slash syncs the directory itself

rsync -a source/ destination

The -a flag indicates archive, which means that file characteristics such as permissions, groups, owners, and symlinks are preserved.

rsync -a -progress source/ destination
-P

The progress flag shows a progress bar.

Trailing slash caveat

-insert text here

Dry run option

rsync -av â€”dry-run source/ destination
-av -n

Check what files will be synced before running.  The -n flag indicates dry-run, and the -v flag indicates verbose, to output the results to the terminal.
