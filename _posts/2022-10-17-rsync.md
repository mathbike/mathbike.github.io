**The rsync tool, short for remote sync, is a file synchronization tool.  Like git, it transfers only the data that has changed.**

## Install

- Arch Linux:
```terminal
sudo pacman -S rsync
```

- Debian:
```terminal
sudo apt-get install rsync
```

---

## Use

- To use rsync, run the rsync command followed by any flags, then the source location followed by the destination location.
```terminal
rsynyc source destination
```

- Use * to select all files within the directory:
```terminal
rsync -r source/* destination
```

- Use the -r flag with a trailing slash to recursively select all files and directories within the directory:
```terminal
rsync -r source/ destination
```

- Without a trailing slash syncs the directory itself:
```terminal
rsync -r source destination
```

- The -a flag indicates archive, which means that file characteristics such as permissions, groups, owners, and symlinks are preserved:
```terminal
rsync -a source/ destination
```

- The progress flag shows a progress bar:
```terminal
rsync -a -progress source/ destination
```

- The -P flag shows a progress bar:
```terminal
rsync -a -P source/ destination
```

## Trailing slash caveat

-insert text here

## Dry run option

```terminal
rsync -av â€”dry-run source/ destination
```

Check what files will be synced before running.  The -n flag indicates dry-run, and the -v flag indicates verbose, to output the results to the terminal.

```terminal
mike@ipaddress:mnt/backup
```
Then enter password
